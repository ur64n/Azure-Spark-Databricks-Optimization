# Azure-Spark-Databricks-Optimization
The project aimed to build scalable, reusable, and parameterized pipelines in Azure Data Factory using Databricks notebooks and Parquet data in Azure Data Lake, based on OLAP and medallion architecture. Optimization techniques like AQE, CBO hints, partitioning, and Spark UI-based tuning were applied.
